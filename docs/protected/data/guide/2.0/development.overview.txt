# Overview

SourceBans 2 is based on the Yii PHP framework. With features such as MVC, DAO/ActiveRecord, I18N/L10N,
caching, testing and much more, you can quickly extend functionality without modifying the SourceBans code.
To learn about the basics of Yii, visit their [guide](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/quickstart.what-is-yii).
For information about classes, methods, properties or events, see our [API documentation](/api).

## PHP scripts

To access SourceBans functionality in an external PHP script, simply include `api.php` like so:
~~~
[php]
include '/path/to/sourcebans/api.php';

// Find web group with name "Owner"
$group = SBGroup::model()->findByAttributes(array('name' => 'Owner'));

// Add admin
$admin = new SBAdmin;
$admin->name = 'Demo';
$admin->auth = SBAdmin::AUTH_STEAM;
$admin->identity = 'STEAM_0:1:2';
$admin->group_id = $group->id;

if($admin->save() == false)
{
	// Saving failed, output errors
	echo CHtml::errorSummary($admin);
}
~~~

## Web plugins

Web plugins are integrated with SourceBans and are loaded for every page. They can add or modify behavior,
and have their own installation and uninstallation procedures, as well as a settings page.
Please refer to the [Web Plugins](/guide/development.web-plugins) section for in-depth information and examples.

## Game plugins

Game plugins are [SourceMod](http://sourcemod.net) plugins that include `sourcebans.inc` to access the SourceBans database from a game server.
The database connection is managed by the core plugin, which greatly reduces the codebase for third-party plugins.
Please refer to the [Game Plugins](/guide/development.game-plugins) section for in-depth information and examples.
