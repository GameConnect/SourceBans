# Servers

## Server queries

To retrieve info such as the hostname of the server and the map currently playing,
as well as players and rules (public console variables and their values),
we can use the [ServerQuery] class:
~~~
[php]
$server = SBServer::model()->findByPk(1);
$query  = new ServerQuery($server->host, $server->port);

print_r($query->getInfo());
print_r($query->getPlayers());
print_r($query->getRules());
~~~

## RCON

Additionally, we can use the [ServerRcon] class to execute RCON commands:
~~~
[php]
// Find all Team Fortress 2 servers
$servers = SBServer::model()->with('game')->findAll('game.folder = "tf"');

foreach($servers as $server)
{
	$rcon = new ServerRcon($server->host, $server->port, $server->rcon);
	if(!$rcon->auth())
		continue;
	
	echo $rcon->execute('sm plugins list'), "\n";
}
~~~
