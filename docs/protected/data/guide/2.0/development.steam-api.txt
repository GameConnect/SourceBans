# Steam API

> Note: The Steam APIs are fairly slow. Please consider caching the data for at least a minute.

To access the Steam Community Data and Web API, we can use the [SteamProfile], [SteamGroup] and [SteamGame] classes.

> Note: Some of the functionality provided in these classes requires a Steam Web API Key. Since each user must register
> their own API key, make sure to warn the user that your code requires an API key, or make that functionality optional.

When working with Steam Community IDs, note that not all versions of PHP support these large numbers.  
To be safe, pass them as strings, as shown in the first example.

## Steam Profile

To retrieve a player's Steam profile, pass their Steam Community ID or custom URL to the constructor:
~~~
[php]
$profile = new SteamProfile('76561197990304788');

echo $profile->steamID; // will output "Tsunami"

foreach($profile->getFriends() as $friend)
{
	echo $friend['steamid'], "\n";
}
~~~
This information is accessible for admins and bans through [SBAdmin::community] and [SBBan::community].

## Steam Group

The same method as above applies to Steam groups:
~~~
[php]
$group = new SteamGroup('GameConnect');

echo $group->headline; // will output "GameConnect - Serious Gaming"

foreach($group->members as $steamid)
{
	echo $steamid, "\n";
}
~~~

## Steam Game

Lastly, to retrieve information about a game and its news on Steam:
~~~
[php]
$game   = new SteamGame(440);
$schema = $game->getSchema();

echo $schema['gameName']; // will output "Team Fortress 2"

foreach($game->getNews(5, 500) as $news)
{
	echo $news['title'], "\n";
}
~~~
