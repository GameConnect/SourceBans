# Installation

SourceBans consists of a game plugin that runs on your Source game server, and a web application that is hosted on your web server.

## Requirements

SourceBans requires PHP 5.3 and MySQL 5.0 or above. It has been tested with [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/),
but it may also run on other Web servers and platforms, provided PHP 5.3 is supported. For [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org),
refer to this [sample host configuration](http://yiiframework.com/doc/guide/quickstart.apache-nginx-config#nginx).

Your game server requires [Metamod:Source](http://metamodsource.net) and [SourceMod](http://sourcemod.net).
To install these, refer to the [Game Plugin](#game-plugin) section.

## Web Application

Follow these three steps to get started with the SourceBans web application:

1. Download SourceBans from [GitHub](http://github.com/GameConnect/SourceBans).
2. Copy the contents of the **web** folder to a Web-accessible folder.
3. Visit <http://hostname/sourcebans/install> to start the installation.

## Game Plugin

In this section, we will refer to the folder where your game server is installed as the "game folder".  
For example, for Counter-Strike: Source, this folder is called **cstrike**.  
For Day of Defeat: Source and Team Fortress 2, it is **dod** or **tf** respectively.

A complete list of supported games can be found on <http://hostname/sourcebans/index.php/admin/games>.

Metamod:Source

:   Download the release for your game server's operating system from [metamodsource.net](http://metamodsource.net/downloads),  
    and unpack the file to the *game folder* on your server. This will create an **addons** folder.

:   [Create a VDF file](http://metamodsource.net/vdf) by selecting your game from the list. If your game is not listed,  
    type the *game folder* in the corresponding text field. Otherwise, leave the field empty.  
    Click "Generate metamod.vdf", and place the file in your **addons** folder.

SourceMod

:   Download the release for your game server's operating system from [sourcemod.net](http://sourcemod.net/downloads.php),  
    and unpack the file to the *game folder* on your server. It should merge with the **addons** and **cfg** folders.

> Note: The stable releases of Metamod:Source and SourceMod may not always support your game.
Development snapshots can be found [here](http://metamodsource.net/snapshots) and [here](http://sourcemod.net/snapshots.php).

SourceBans Game Plugin

:   Copy the contents of the **game** folder in the SourceBans package, to the *game folder* on your server.  
    It should merge with the **addons/sourcemod** folder.

:   Visit <http://hostname/sourcebans/index.php/servers/config> and follow the instructions. It consists of opening
    **addons/sourcemod/configs/databases.cfg** on your server and copy-pasting the "sourcebans" section.

:   Lastly, open **addons/sourcemod/configs/sourcebans.cfg** and edit it for your needs.
