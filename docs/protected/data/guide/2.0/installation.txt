# Installation

SourceBans consists of a game plugin that runs on your Source game server, and a web application that is hosted on your web server.

## Requirements

SourceBans requires PHP 5.2 and MySQL 5.0 or above. It has been tested with [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/),  
but it may also run on other Web servers and platforms, provided PHP 5.2 is supported.

Your game server requires [Metamod:Source](http://metamodsource.net) and [SourceMod](http://sourcemod.net).
To install these, refer to the [Game Plugin](#game-plugin) section.

## Web Application

1. Download SourceBans from [GitHub](http://github.com/GameConnect/SourceBans).
2. Copy the contents of the *web* folder to a Web-accessible folder.
3. Visit <http://hostname/sourcebans/install> to start the installation.

> Tip: The *application* and *framework* directories do not need to be installed under a
Web-accessible directory. The application has one entry script which is usually the only
file that needs to be exposed to Web users. Other PHP scripts, including those
from Yii, should be protected from Web access; otherwise they might be exploited 
by hackers.

## Game Plugin

In this section, we will refer to the folder where your game server is installed as the "game folder".  
For example, for Counter-Strike: Source, this folder would be called **cstrike**.  
For Day of Defeat: Source and Team Fortress 2, it would be **dod** or **tf** respectively.

Metamod:Source

:   Download the release for your game server's operating system from [metamodsource.net](http://metamodsource.net/downloads),  
    and unpack the file to the *game folder* on your server. This will create an **addons** folder.

:   [Create a VDF file](http://metamodsource.net/vdf) by selecting your game from the list. If your game is not listed,  
    type the *game folder* in the corresponding text field. Otherwise, leave the field empty.  
    Click "Generate metamod.vdf", and place the file in your **addons** folder.

SourceMod

:   Download the release for your game server's operating system from [sourcemod.net](http://sourcemod.net/downloads.php),  
    and unpack the file to the *game folder* on your server. It will merge with the **addons** and **cfg** folders.

> Note: The stable releases of Metamod:Source and SourceMod may not always support your game.
Development snapshots can be found [here](http://metamodsource.net/snapshots) and [here](http://sourcemod.net/snapshots.php).

SourceBans Game Plugin

:   Copy the contents of the **game** folder in the SourceBans package, to the *game folder* on your server.  
    It will merge with the **addons/sourcemod** folder.
